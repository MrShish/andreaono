## Otorongo

### Personal project, 2022

In Peru, the jaguar, known as “otorongo”, is almost threatened by deforestation, indiscriminate hunting and habitat loss. I would love to add meaning to what I do and the protection of animals is something that moves me. By making this and future illustrations, I hope to make their realities known. So this is a work in progress. I used Illustrator and Photoshop.
