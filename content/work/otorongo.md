## Otorongo

### Personal project, 2022

In Peru, the jaguar is called “otorongo”. This species that is threatened by deforestation, indiscriminate hunting, habitat loss and human conflicts. By making this illustration, I hope to make its reality known. I would love to add meaning to what I create and the protection of endangered animals is something that moves me. So this is a work in progress. I used Illustrator and Photoshop.
